The internet experiment had the client connecting to each server (eastUS, centralUS, europe, australia), for each alg (kex/sig), for each page (1kB, 10kB, 100kB, 1MB), for 120 seconds:
 - one for 60 seconds (see results in 60sec/)
 
The results are separated in the east/, central/, europe/, australia/ folders. In each folder, the kex and sig were launched as follows:
    - perl ../ab_perf_kex.pl <server_ip> na 1 120 > <server>_kex.out &
    - perl ../ab_perf_sig.pl <server_ip> na 1 120 > <server>_sig.out &

The ab_perf_[kex|sig].pl script uses a modified apache benchmarking (ab) tool (to support TLS 1.3, add PQC, add server cert validation), taken from https://github.com/christianpaquin/httpd/tree/cp-enable-tls13-ab (built using the optimized OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1 fork). The resulting output files are in the corresponding VM folders.

To extract data for comparison and plotting: 
For KEX (replace "50" by "95" or other percentile for other data):
 - extract the median value for each run:
     grep "50%" ab-kex-L1-*.txt | sed -E "s/^ab-kex-L1-(.*)-ecdsap256-index(.*)\.html\.txt:  50%\s*(.*)/\1,\2,\3/" > ab_kex_sed_50.out
 - merge mean values into one csv file:
     ../../convert_kex_to_csv.sh > ab_kex.csv

For sig (replace "50" by "95" or other percentile for other data):
 - extract the median value for each run:
     grep "50%" ab-sig-L1-*.txt | sed -E "s/^ab-sig-L1-p256-kyber512_90s-(.*)-index(.*)\.html\.txt:  50%\s*(.*)/\1,\2,\3/" > ab_sig_sed_50.out
 - merge mean values into one csv file:
     ../../convert_sig_to_csv.sh > ab_sig.csv


To convert the data for latex-friently plotting, use prepare_plotdata.sh.
